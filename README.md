## How It Was Built

- **Backend**: Built using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose for MongoDB. Implemented endpoints to support multi-session chat functionality with unique session IDs (using the uuid package)
- **Frontend**: Built using React for a responsive interface. The app handles simultaneous display of PDFs and chat, dynamic quiz generation, progress tracking, and caters to user interactivity by storing session data for persistence across refreshes
- **LLM Usage**: Leveraged LLM coding tools to rapidly develop and iterate on features such as the chat interface and quiz engine

## What's Done and What's Missing

### Completed
- Complete implementation of must-have features: source selector, PDF viewer, quiz generation engine, progress tracking
- Nice-to-have features like the Chat UI and YouTube video recommender have been implemented with emphasis on responsiveness and clean design
- Multi-session chat functionality with persistent session data
- Backend and frontend deployed on Render and Vercel respectively

### Missing/To Improve
- Further UI/UX enhancements for mobile responsiveness and visual polish
- Additional testing and refinements in areas of scalability and error handling
- Further optimization in leveraging LLM tools for feature expansion

## Development Journey

The development process was fully tracked via verifiable commits. Each significant changeâ€”from initial scaffolding to final feature adjustmentsâ€”can be reviewed in the commit history.

Decisions on the technology stack and architectural design were informed by both rapid prototyping and iterative feedback sessions.
